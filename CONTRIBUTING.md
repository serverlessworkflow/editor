# Contributing to Serverless Workflow Editor

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the CNCF Serverless Workflow Editor! We welcome all types of contributions, including bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code changes.

This project is the official, vendor-neutral visual editor for the [Serverless Workflow Specification](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification).

---

## Prerequisites

To build and run the editor locally, you will need:

- **Node.js** (current LTS version; see https://nodejs.org/)
- **pnpm**

## Building the Project

The project is structured as a monorepo to support multiple distribution targets (Web, VS Code, etc.) as defined in our architectural decisions.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/editor.git
cd editor

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages in the monorepo (development)
pnpm run build:dev

# Or build all packages in the monorepo (production)
pnpm run build:prod
```

## Development Environment

This project uses the following technology stack:

- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with strict mode enabled
- **UI Library**: [React](https://react.dev/)
- **Diagram Rendering**: [@xyflow/react](https://reactflow.dev/) (isolated in `src/react-flow/`)
- **Workflow SDK**: [@serverlessworkflow/sdk](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-typescript) (isolated in `src/core/`)
- **Testing**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit tests, [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for E2E
- **Linting**: [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/) with TypeScript, React, import, and jsx-a11y plugins
- **Formatting**: [oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/)
- **Component Development**: [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

The project aims for the editor to be **embeddable**, with the core logic decoupled from specific platform APIs (like VS Code or Chrome APIs) through an abstraction layer.

## Reporting an Issue

If you find a bug or have a question, please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/editor/issues) first.

1. Open a new issue using the appropriate template.
2. Provide a clear description of the problem.
3. Include steps to reproduce the bug and provide a sample workflow file (`.json` or `.yaml`) if applicable.

## Suggesting a Change

For new features or architectural changes:

1. Open an **Issue** or a **GitHub Discussion** to propose your idea.
2. Ensure the proposal aligns with the goals of being **vendor-neutral** and **specification-first**.
3. Once the approach is agreed upon by maintainers, you may proceed with a Pull Request.

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: Always use strict typing. Avoid `any`.
- **Linting & Formatting**: Follow the existing code style and formatting conventions used in the files you are editing. If the package you are changing defines linting or formatting scripts, run those before submitting code.
- **Testing**: Ensure that logic changes are covered by tests, and run the relevant test commands for the packages you modify (see their documentation or `package.json`).
- **Component Design**: Follow functional component patterns and ensure that UI state is managed predictably within the monorepo structure.
- **New package creation**: If a new package needs to be created, please follow the standards used by the existing packages, including the standard commands `build:dev`, `build:prod`, `test`, `e2e-test`, `lint`.

## LLM Usage Policy

In this project, we welcome tools that help developers become more productive — including Large Language Models (LLMs) and agents like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and others. To ensure a healthy and productive community, the following expectations apply:

- Use LLMs to **assist your development** — drafting code, writing docs, proposing fixes — as long as you **understand, validate, and take responsibility** for the results.
- Only submit contributions that reflect your **own understanding and intent**.
- You may use LLMs to help you **write better**, but not to **post more**.

### Requirements

- Verify behavior, correctness, and compatibility yourself before submitting. Do not ask maintainers to do this for you.
- Keep changes narrow and focused. Posting large volumes of low-effort suggestions, vague issues, or links with no context — even if technically accurate — is considered spam.
- Do **NOT** submit code, tests, comments, or issues that are copied directly from an LLM with little or no human oversight. Be prepared to explain all the changes yourself.
- Do **NOT** submit AI-generated tests that do not validate actual behavior or meaningfully cover functionality.
- Do **NOT** use bots, agents, or automated tools to open PRs, file issues, or post content without human authorship and responsibility.
- Do **NOT** include private code, credentials, tokens, or confidential material.
- Respect licensing and attribution requirements.

### Consequences

1. We may close issues, PRs, or discussions that violate this policy without detailed explanation.
2. Repeated violations may result in temporary or permanent restrictions from participating in the project.

### If in Doubt

If you're unsure whether your use of agents/LLMs is acceptable — ask! We're happy to help contributors learn how to use AI tools effectively **without creating noise**.

> This isn't about banning AI — it's about keeping this project collaborative, human-driven, and focused on quality.

## Git Hooks

The project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to manage Git hooks automatically after `pnpm install`:

- **`pre-commit`**: Runs `lint-staged` to automatically format staged files matching `*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,md,yml,yaml}` using oxfmt.
- **`commit-msg`**: Validates that commits include a DCO `Signed-off-by` line. Commits without sign-off will be rejected.

These hooks help maintain code quality and ensure compliance with project requirements.

## Testing

The project uses multiple testing strategies:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are written using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with React Testing Library. Tests mirror the source structure in `tests/`:

```bash
cd packages/serverless-workflow-diagram-editor
pnpm test
```

### End-to-End Tests

E2E tests use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and are located in `tests-e2e/`:

```bash
cd packages/serverless-workflow-diagram-editor
pnpm test-e2e          # Run tests headless
pnpm test-e2e:ui       # Run with Playwright UI
```

Before running E2E tests for the first time, install Playwright browsers:

```bash
# From root directory
pnpm playwright:install:ci
```

### Type Checking

Run TypeScript type checking:

```bash
cd packages/serverless-workflow-diagram-editor
pnpm typecheck
```

## Continuous Integration

Pull requests automatically trigger:

- **Netlify Deploy Previews**: Storybook is automatically built and deployed for PRs that modify the `@serverlessworkflow/diagram-editor` package, allowing reviewers to preview changes interactively.
- **Automated Checks**: Linting, type checking, tests, and builds must pass before merging.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Commit** your changes with clear, descriptive messages.
3. **DCO Sign-off**: As a CNCF project, all commits must be signed off (`git commit -s`) to certify the Developer Certificate of Origin. The `commit-msg` hook will automatically verify sign-off is present.
4. **Verify** your changes by running the appropriate build and/or test commands for the packages you modified.
5. If your PR changes a package, run `pnpm changeset` and commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` file.  
   As an alternative you may prefer to compare against upstream explicitly:

   ```bash
   pnpm changeset --since upstream/main
   ```

   **Note:** If you don't have the `upstream` remote configured:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/editor.git
   ```

6. **Submit** a Pull Request (PR).
7. **Review**: At least one maintainer must review and approve your PR before it is merged.
