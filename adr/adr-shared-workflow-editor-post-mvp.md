# ADR: Post-MVP Roadmap for the Serverless Workflow Editor

**Status:** Proposed

> This ADR sets out the **post-MVP roadmap** for the Serverless Workflow editor - how it grows from the existing read-only viewer into a full visual authoring tool. The MVP (read-only visualisation) is covered by the prior [ADR](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/main/adr/v1.0-adr-shared-workflow-editor.md) and assumed here as the starting point.

## Purpose

The purpose of this ADR is to **align the community on the planned phases and release sequence** for the editor beyond the MVP, and to gather feedback before work proceeds.

It is intentionally a roadmap, not a schedule: **no delivery dates or effort estimates are committed here**. Sequencing reflects dependency and risk; timing depends on resources and priorities. Tooling choices (e.g. the embedded code editor) are likewise left open for community input.

## Context

The MVP is a read-only diagram viewer: it renders a workflow from YAML/JSON and surfaces validation errors, and is published as an embeddable package. This ADR covers what comes **after** that - turning the viewer into an editor.

## Decision

Grow the read-only editor into a **full visual authoring tool**, delivered **incrementally** - releasing usable value at every phase rather than waiting for a "complete" product. Editing capabilities are layered on in safe, shippable phases, each building on the last.

Two principles guide the design:

1. **The text (YAML/JSON) is the source of truth.** The diagram is a view of the text. Edits made on the diagram are written back into the text.
2. **Release after every phase.** Each phase below stands on its own and delivers real value - nobody waits for the entire roadmap.

## Licensing

- **Apache 2.0** (consistent with Serverless Workflow specification)
- All dependencies must be CNCF-compatible

## Governance & Community Alignment

- The editor is developed and maintained **as part of the Serverless Workflow project**, by the community rather than any single vendor.
- A **multi-maintainer model** with representatives from Quarkus Flow/Sonata Flow, Serverless Workflow Specification maintainers and other interested engine maintainers (e.g Zigflow/Synapse/Lemline etc) following spec governance model.
- The **specification remains the authority**: the editor follows the spec, it does not extend or fork it. Where editor work surfaces gaps or ambiguities, those are raised back to the specification.

## Scope

Post-MVP work runs in two parallel streams.

- **Stream 1 - the editor itself:** growing from read-only viewing toward full visual authoring.
- **Stream 2 - integrations:** embedding the same shared package into the tools people already use (e.g. VS Code extension). This stream is **isolated from Stream 1** - because every target embeds the same package, integration work has no hard dependency on the editing milestones and _can_ proceed in parallel. Whether it actually runs in parallel is purely a question of **available resources and priorities**, not of technical sequencing.

## Milestones

Phases pick up from the existing read-only viewer and are ordered from **safest/simplest to hardest**; each is independently releasable. **No delivery dates are committed here** - sequencing reflects dependency and risk, not a schedule.

### Milestone 1 - Side-by-side text + diagram

A split view: edit the workflow text on one side, see the diagram refresh on the other, with inline validation. Schema-driven authoring assistance (autocomplete / IntelliSense) makes the editor approachable for newcomers and faster for those debugging existing files.

### Milestone 2 - Edit a node

Select an existing node on the diagram and edit it directly; the change is written back to the text. This is the point at which the diagram becomes genuinely editable.

### Milestone 3 - Build & wire the workflow

Construct and reshape the whole workflow visually - add and remove nodes instead of hand-editing nested text. The most complex phase, delivered last once the foundations are solid.

> **On drag-and-drop:** we are **not** planning free-form drag-and-drop canvas editing - it adds disproportionate layout and connection complexity for the value it returns. Instead, structural editing will use a simpler, more constrained interaction (e.g. an explicit add node button), with the exact design **to be confirmed** through dedicated design work.

### Integrations (independent, parallel stream)

The same shared package is embedded into target tools. This work is **self-contained and decoupled** from the Stream 1 milestones - it can start at any point after and run alongside them, but doing so depends entirely on **available people and agreed priorities**, not on reaching a particular editing milestone. Each integration adopts the editor capabilities that make it worthwhile in that context.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- One shared editor, consistent across implementations.
- Reduced duplication - implementations embed instead of rebuild.
- Value released early and often, not gated on a finished product.

**Trade-offs**

- A shared, neutral editor takes longer to reach feature-complete than a single vendor optimising for itself alone.
- Editing arrives in stages, so the most complex authoring features land last.
- Multi-maintainer governance requires coordination and shared decision-making.
