# editor

The official **vendor-neutral visual editor** for the [Open Workflow Specification](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification).

## Overview

This project provides an interactive, visual diagram editor designed to be:

- **Vendor-neutral**: No platform-specific dependencies
- **Embeddable**: Core logic decoupled from platform APIs (VS Code, browser extensions, etc.)
- **Specification-first**: Built around the official Open Workflow Specification

## Prerequisites

To build and run the editor locally, you will need:

- **Node.js**: `^22.13.0 || >=24.0.0` (see [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
- **pnpm**: `10.31.0` (exact version, enforced by `packageManager` field)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/editor.git
cd editor

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages (development)
pnpm run build:dev

# Or build all packages (production - includes linting and tests)
pnpm run build:prod
```

## Development

### Running Storybook

Storybook provides an interactive development environment for the diagram editor:

```bash
cd packages/serverless-workflow-diagram-editor
pnpm start  # Starts Storybook on http://localhost:6006
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd packages/serverless-workflow-diagram-editor

# Unit tests (Vitest)
pnpm test

# E2E tests (Playwright)
pnpm test-e2e          # Headless
pnpm test-e2e:ui       # With Playwright UI

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting
pnpm lint
```

Before running E2E tests for the first time:

```bash
# From root directory
pnpm playwright:install:ci
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format all files
pnpm format

# Check formatting without modifying
pnpm format:check

# Check dependency versions across packages
pnpm dependencies:check

# Fix dependency version mismatches
pnpm dependencies:fix
```

## Packages

### [@serverlessworkflow/diagram-editor](./packages/serverless-workflow-diagram-editor)

The main visual diagram editor component built with:

- **TypeScript** (strict mode)
- **React**
- **[@xyflow/react](https://reactflow.dev/)** for diagram rendering (isolated in `src/react-flow/`)
- **[@serverlessworkflow/sdk](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-typescript)** (isolated in `src/core/`)
- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** for UI primitives (with `dec:` Tailwind prefix)
- **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)** for component development
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** and **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)** for testing

### [@serverlessworkflow/i18n](./packages/i18n)

Internationalization utilities used by the diagram editor.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with strict mode
- **UI Framework**: [React](https://react.dev/)
- **Diagram Library**: [@xyflow/react](https://reactflow.dev/) (React Flow)
- **Auto Layout**: [ELK.js](https://eclipse.dev/elk/)
- **Workflow SDK**: [@serverlessworkflow/sdk](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-typescript)
- **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) + [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Testing**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
- **Linting**: [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/)
- **Formatting**: [oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/)
- **Component Development**: [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- **Package Manager**: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## Architecture

The diagram editor maintains strict separation of concerns:

- **SDK Isolation**: Only `src/core/workflowSdk.ts` and `src/core/graph.ts` import from `@serverlessworkflow/sdk`
- **React Flow Isolation**: All `@xyflow/react` code is contained in `src/react-flow/`
- **Platform Agnostic**: Core logic decoupled from platform-specific APIs
- **Embeddable**: Designed for integration into VS Code, web apps, and browser extensions

See [adr/](./adr/) for Architecture Decision Records.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on:

- Setting up your development environment
- Coding standards and best practices
- Testing requirements
- Pull request process
- DCO sign-off requirements (required for all commits)

### DCO Sign-off

As a CNCF project, all commits must include a `Signed-off-by` line:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

The `commit-msg` hook will automatically verify DCO compliance.

## Continuous Integration

- **Automated Testing**: All PRs run linting, type checking, unit tests, and E2E tests
- **Netlify Previews**: Storybook is automatically deployed for PRs modifying the diagram editor package
- **Dependency Updates**: Automated via Dependabot
- **License Header Checks**: Apache 2.0 headers verified on all source files

## Release Process

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management:

```bash
# Create a changeset when making package changes
pnpm changeset

# Or compare against upstream explicitly
pnpm changeset --since upstream/main
```

See [RELEASE_PROCESS.md](./RELEASE_PROCESS.md) for details.
